# TDD and OOP practice assessment...IN SPACE!

Clone the GitHub repository from the button below.

In this assessment, you will be implementing a model of celestial bodies,
spaceships, and astronauts based solely on test specs and your TDD/OOP skills.

Read the specs carefully to understand the requirements and file
structure of the project. About halfway through the spec you will start
to see functions and logic that require other aspects of the spec to be
working properly. It is likely you will want to start jumping around a bit
to see the bigger picture so the pieces can start fitting together.

I hope you enjoy and have fun!!!
